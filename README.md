Credit Scoring Model
Overview
This project is a Credit Scoring Model that predicts creditworthiness using machine learning. It takes customer data as input and determines whether they are creditworthy based on classification algorithms.

Dataset
The dataset includes financial and demographic features such as age, balance, campaign history, job type, and marital status. The model was trained using a dataset similar to the Credit Scoring Model Dataset from Kaggle.

Usage
Load a new dataset and preprocess it.

Train the model using the provided dataset.

Make predictions on new data.

Model Performance
Train Accuracy: 92%
Test Accuracy: 87%

Evaluation Metrics: Precision, Recall, and F1-score show that the model performs well, particularly for identifying non-creditworthy individuals.

Files Included
credit_scoring.py – The main script for training and testing the model.
dataset.csv – The dataset used for training/testing.
new_data.csv – A sample file to test new predictions.

Testing the Model
You can test the model by providing inputs in a CSV file with the required features and running the prediction script.

Contribution
